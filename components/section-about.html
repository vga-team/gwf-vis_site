      With the earth experiencing a drammatically changing climate, scientists
      are relying on hydrological models to understand and cope up with extreme
      events such as droughts and floods. The GWF-Vis library provides a set of
      APIs to create an interactive visual analytics dashboard to visualize
      geospatial data such as the ones produced by hydrological models. The GWF-Vis
      library (<a href="https://github.com/vga-team/gwf-vis_lib/wiki">Wiki</a>)
      can be installed through a terminal or Jupyter Notebook. Interested users may
      refer to (<a href="https://github.com/vga-team">VGA</a>) for development
      details.
